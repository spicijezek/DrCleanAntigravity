# Future Roadmap & Upgrades for Dr.Clean

## 1. AI-Powered Scheduling & Optimization 🧠
- **Smart Assignment**: Automatically suggest the best cleaner based on travel time (using Google Maps API), skills, and historical client feedback.
- **Route Optimization**: For cleaners with multiple jobs, optimize the sequence to save fuel and time.
- **Demand Forecasting**: Predict busy periods (holidays) and suggest increasing cleaner availability.

## 2. Cleaner Experience (Mobile App Features) 📱
- **Geolocation Check-in**: Prevent "started early" fraud by requiring cleaners to be within 50m of the property to start the job.
- **Offline Checklist**: Allow cleaners to check off rooms in basements/elevators without signal, syncing when online.
- **Shift Management**: Let cleaners set availability directly in the app.
- **Real-time Chat**: Dedicated secure chat between Admin and Cleaner (avoiding WhatsApp).

## 3. Client Interaction & Trust 🛡️
- **Photo Uploads**: Allow clients to upload photos of "problem spots" when booking.
- **Before/After Gallery**: Cleaners take photos of completed work to show clients the result.
- **Live ETA**: Uber-style tracking of the cleaner approaching the property.
- **Tip Your Cleaner**: Allow digital tipping after a job.

## 4. Business Automation ⚙️
- **Inventory Managment**: Track consumption of cleaning supplies per job.
- **Automatic Invoicing**: Integrate with Fakturoid/Xero to auto-send invoices upon job completion.
- **Subscription Models**: "Set and forget" recurring payments (e.g., "Weekly Club").

## 5. Gamification & Retention 🏆
- **Cleaner Leaderboard**: Points for punctuality, 5-star ratings, and completed checklists.
- **Rewards Store**: Redeem points for bonuses or equipment.
- **Client Tiers**: "Gold" clients get priority booking and free add-ons (like Fridge cleaning).

## 6. Technical Enhancements 🚀
- **PWA (Progressive Web App)**: Full installability on iOS/Android without App Store approval.
- **Push Notifications**: Native push notifications via OneSignal for "Cleaner is on the way" or "New Job Assigned".
- **Performance**: Implement edge caching for static assets and lazy-loading for all heavy components.
